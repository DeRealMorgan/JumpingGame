# JumpingGame
This game was implemented as an android application for the course "IT basiertes lernen gestalten", TUM.
The project is ready and can be installed on an emulator or physical device.

As this project was very limited in time the code is not very clean and may contain bugs.
This project is abandoned now and will not be changed or updated in the near future.
